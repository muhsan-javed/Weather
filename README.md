# Weather App in Kotlin

This is a weather app built using Kotlin programming language. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for various locations and provides users with up-to-date weather information and forecasts.

#  Features
Current weather information for user's location or any other location of interest
7-day forecast with predicted high and low temperatures for each day
Detailed information such as humidity, wind speed, and chance of precipitation
Toggle between different units of measurement (e.g. Celsius and Fahrenheit)
Location-based weather alerts and push notifications for severe weather conditions
Additional information such as sunrise and sunset times, moon phase, and UV index.

# Installation
To run the app, you will need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Once you have the API key, create a new file local.properties in the project root directory and add the following line:

OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>

Replace <your_api_key_here> with your actual API key.

WorkManager for background updates
Room for data persistence
ViewModel and LiveData for data management
